**The project was created with:**

*Pyton 3.10.6*

*Poetry 1.4.2*


### MakeFile
*To install the program in a virtual environment, use:*

`make install` to install poetry packages

`make build` to build the package inside the system

`make publish` to publish commands program

`make packege-install` to install the package on the system


### The program is a set of five logical mini-games, below are examples of how each game works:

**Game: "Parity check"**

The essence of the game is as follows: the user is shown a random number. And he needs to answer yes if the number is even, or no if it is odd.

**Game: "Calculator"**

The essence of the game is as follows: the user is shown a random mathematical expression, for example 35 + 16, which must be calculated and 
the correct answer written down.

**Game: "Greatest common divisor"**

The essence of the game is as follows: the user is shown two random numbers, for example, 25 50. The user must calculate and enter the greatest 
common divisor of these numbers.

**Game: "Arithmetic progression"**

The player is given a series of numbers forming an arithmetic progression, replacing any of the numbers with two dots. The player must determine this number.

**Game: "Is it a prime number?"**

The player needs to determine if the number is prime.

### To launch games use the following commands:

*Game: "Parity check":* `brain-even`

*Game: "Calculator":* `brain-calc`

*Game: "Greatest common divisor":* `brain-gcd`

*Game: "Arithmetic progression":* `brain-progression`

*Game: "Is it a prime number?":* `brain-prime`
